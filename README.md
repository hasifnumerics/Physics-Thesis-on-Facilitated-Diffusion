# Optimization of Transcription Factor Search Times

## Overview
This repository contains the comprehensive work of Hasif Ahmed's physics thesis, focusing on the dynamics of transcription factor search times. Through a comparative analysis, this thesis explores both classical diffusion models (1D and 3D) and facilitated diffusion mechanisms. The work can be accessed [here](https://github.com/hasifnumerics/Physics-Thesis-on-Facilitated-Diffusion/blob/60a77c4e0bbc4efde2f87a0f7694a280c5b6fb3d/Hasif_Ahmed_Physics_Thesis%20(4).pdf).


## Key Findings
- Demonstrated that facilitated diffusion significantly accelerates transcription factor search times compared to classical diffusion models.
- Quantitative analysis reveals a substantial reduction in search times, aligning with empirical observations.
- The study suggests that molecular crowding and specific DNA sequences play a pivotal role in optimizing search efficiency.
- Potential applications in developing artificial biosystems and targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Methodology
- Utilized advanced computational simulations to model transcription factor movements.
- Applied statistical analysis to compare search efficiencies between different diffusion models.

## Conclusion
This thesis provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of cellular functions, emphasizing the importance of facilitated diffusion in biological processes.
